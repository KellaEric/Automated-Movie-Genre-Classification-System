This research paper presents the design, development, and implementation of an automated movie genre classification system utilizing web technologies and the Open Movie Database (OMDb) Application Programming Interface. The system addresses the growing need for efficient movie data management and analysis in digital libraries, streaming services, and personal collections. Through a web-based interface built with Python's Streamlit framework, the system enables both individual and batch processing of movie metadata, providing comprehensive classification, statistical analysis, and data visualization capabilities. The implementation demonstrates significant improvements in time efficiency, accuracy, and user accessibility compared to manual classification methods. Performance evaluation indicates a 95% reduction in processing time for batch operations and high accuracy in genre classification when compared to standard movie databases.
